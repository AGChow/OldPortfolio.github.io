I'm a self taught game dev based in **Chicago IL**. Like many, I grew up and fell in love with video games in my youth, but, as I grow older, the artistry and engineering required to craft these experiences continues to hold my attention. Thus, I enjoy working on 3d models and animations as well as designing fun interactive systems.

### <u>Forsaken Flame</u>

Made in a month with a group of four devs. We designed the puzzles around the central mechanic of throwing and recalling a flaming sword. This sword had properties and we made it so that every puzzle revealed something new about how player can use the sword to interact with the world. We designed a final boss battle with three stages that increased in difficulty. The boss, we felt, was only beatable if the players had internalized the lessons of the previous levels.

### <u>Frog's Revenge</u>

Made in 24 hours for a Unity game jam. The theme was "Modernize a Classic". I chose to modernize frogger by adding gameplay elements that give the player more agency and spent a lot of time adding "juice" that I felt was missing in the original 2-D version. I modeled, rigged and animated the tree frog in Blender. However, I chose to model and animate the flies in unity.

### <u>Duck Adventure</u>

This was made over the course of one week. I modeled, rigged, and animated the duck myself and wrote the codebase. I took special notice on this game to include non intrusive tutorials and a couple of levels for the player to advance in. I added a boost for later obstacles and player expression. I also added areas for the duck to be able to hide from enemies.

### <u>MaskTheTruth</u>

This was made in 1 week for a Halloween Game Jam. It's an interactive diorama where the player can trick or treat around the neighborhood. There are interactive elements like a soccer field. Motivated players might choose to kick the ball into the net, and it'll result in a big drop of candies for the player. There is also a cute haunted house and a giant jack o lantern for the player to see. I modeled the main character and designed the space. I also wrote the code base for this project. I was aiming for a sort of relaxed small town feel.
